# React BankingApp

Site currently hosted at: https://v993.github.io/BankingApp/

BankingApp is an app designed specifically to practice the use of 
client-side routing with the use of React Router. This website emulates
typical browser behavior in banking applications with Router, swapping
components using routing patterns while using the state in order to 
preserve and save user information across the site.
